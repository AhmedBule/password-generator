In this project, I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. 

I have created three files. index.html, style.css, and script.js

In my Index.html, I created a form ID and names it passwordGenerator. Thereafter, I had an input number and with max and min. From there on, there were labels for IDs, such as includeUppercase, includeLowercase, and includeSymbols. 


As for the Javascript, I started with DOM and getElementById for all the IDs that I mentioned in the index.html file. Afterwards, I had variables, such as validUpper and validLower, and then I gave a value for each name. 

The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.The math.random returns a random interger and Math.floor rounds a number, variable, or result down.
